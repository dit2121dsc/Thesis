Some researchers developed a number of models to capture the statistical temporal traffic patterns (burstiness on different time scales) based on Poisson or 'self-similar' assumptions [14, 16, 27, 34, 39] . Others focused on statistical spatial traffic patterns (skewness of traffic matrix) and studied how to measure and estimate the traffic matrix [31, 41] . However, most of these models revolve around the statistical characteristics of entire traffic matrices, which are deficient in accuracy and granularity. Recently, an enlightening work was proposed to model the temporal and nontemporal traffic characteristics simultaneously, the problem is that it is on the packet level and it excludes well-concerned information like packet size [6] .",

Flow-level traffic demand refers to the need to transfer data from one end-host to another with arbitrary flow-size and interarrival-time attributes. By analyzing traffic demand, researchers can learn traffic patterns exclude the bias introduced by network protocols and algorithms (e.g., load balancing) used during data collection.",

The assumption behind this approach is that spatial attributes (source, destination) and non-spatial attributes (interarrival time, flow size) are independent, which is contrary to the widely believed locality properties [6, 9, 37] . Besides, even though the all-to-all pattern may be a good representation for MapReduce/Hadoop applications [2] , it's unsuitable to be used as a universal-adapted model considering the heterogeneous mix of services across datacenters. Besides, an all-to-all pattern could hardly be the worst case for scenarios like load balancing, where unbalanced demand patterns are of greater concern. To address this problem, researchers propose many other communicating patterns to simulate real-world scenarios, such as stride for HPC applications and staggered-prob for intra, inter-rack differentiation [2] .

We find strong dependency between spatial attributes (source, destination) and non-spatial attributes (interarrival time, flow size) of flow-level traffic demand, resulting in complex multivariate distribution and various locality properties. Traffic demand within different src-dst pairs is quantitatively imbalanced and behaviorally heterogeneous, e.g., traffic demand among some end-hosts is composed of dense elephant flows, while among others are consist of sparse mice flows. These locality properties should be considered in earnest when designing a traffic demand model. Our findings show that independently modeling the marginal distribution of multi-dimensional traffic demand is unsuitable, and they also reveal that the traffic demand modeling problem is complicated and challenging ( \u00a7 2).",

The term flow in the context of this paper means the observed 4-tuple (src, dst, interarrival time, flow size) with a chosen long inactivity timeout to determine when a flow starts or ends [4] , and the 4-tuple represents the sending node, the receiving node, flow interarrival time, and flow size respectively. Because of space constraints, we take EDU1 as an example to illustrate our analysis results, and EDU2 has similar results. Figure 1a visualizes a fraction of the trace within 16 representative src-dst pairs. In Figure 1a , each row represents one src-dst pair with a corresponding color, and each rectangle represents a flow-arrival event (a flow) within the given source and destination. The width of each rectangle represents the flow size, and the blank between two adjacent rectangles represents the interarrival time. We observe significant difference in interarrival-time (Figure 1b ) and flow-size (Figure 1c ) distributions across src-dst pairs. Besides, we sum up the entries over the entire trace file, resulting in the total demand distribution within these 16 src-dst pairs (Figure 1d ), which reveals the skewness of total demand [6] , i.e., some src-dst pairs transfer more data than others. Finally, we investigate the degree (indegree plus outdegree) of each node in EDU1 (we plot a subset in Figure 1e for space constraints), and the result shows that the degree distribution is also highly skewed. We observe that the majority of nodes have low degree but a few have relatively high degree, indicating the degree distribution is right-skewed in this case.",

For the n-th sending flow ( \u00e2\ud835\udc5f,\ud835\udc5b ) in A \ud835\udc5f , we first sample its functionality index \ud835\udc67 \ud835\udc5f,\ud835\udc5b from the Multinominal distribution with parameter \ud835\udf03 \ud835\udc5f , and then the sending flow \u00e2\ud835\udc5f,\ud835\udc5b can be chosen conditioned on \ud835\udc67 \ud835\udc5f,\ud835\udc5b and \ud835\udefd (line 7-8). After that, we convert the discretized interarrival time bins and flow size bins to continuous values by assuming these variables are distributed evenly within each bin (line 9), and this method was also used in [10] . Finally, we accumulate the interarrival time within each A \ud835\udc5f and move on to the next src-dst pair when the accumulated time overran the given time window (line 10).",

If distributions are identical, the KS-distance is 0, and its maximum possible value is 1. For interarrival time and flow size attributes, we calculate their average KS-distance across all src-dst pairs respectively. Implementation. Our model is implemented in Python using Gensim [36] . We use 8 different \ud835\udc3e values (number of latent functionalities) to test the performance of Lomas. And we set both \ud835\udefc and \ud835\udf02 to 'auto', which is a feature of Gensim that enable automatically parameter learning. Baseline.

Second, Lomas can discover the skewness of traffic matrices, which is helpful for optimizing the datacenter topologies to ensure high bandwidth utilization. Finally, our trained models can generate synthetic traces retaining the traffic demand patterns, and these synthetic benchmarks can be used by researchers to evaluate their designs in different settings (e.g., for longer traces or higher level of traffic demand).. Besides, there are several future directions we wish to explore. First, we plan to reevaluate the existing datacenter optimization proposals [2-4, 8, 18, 29, 33] using our synthetic benchmarks to understand the robustness and applicability of these popular designs. Second, we will explore the possibilities to introduce new techniques to enhance our model performance, e.g., a recurrent neural networks (RNN ) module to capture inter-flow correlations.
