Recent innovations in ubiquitous computing and communication technologies have prompted the rapid integration of highly interconnected systems to ICPSs. Hence, the \"security by obscurity\" principle provided by air-gapping is no longer followed. As the interconnectivity in ICPSs increases, so does the attack surface. Industrial vulnerability assessment reports have shown that a variety of new vulnerabilities have occurred due to this transition. Although there are existing surveys in this context, very little is mentioned regarding the outputs of these reports. While these reports show that the most exploited vulnerabilities occur due to weak boundary protection, these vulnerabilities also occur due to limited or ill-defined security policies. However, current literature focuses on intrusion detection systems (IDSs), network traffic analysis (NTA) methods, or anomaly detection techniques. Hence, finding a solution for the problems mentioned in these reports is relatively hard. We bridge this gap by defining and reviewing ICPSs from a cybersecurity perspective. In particular, multi-dimensional adaptive attack taxonomy is presented and utilized for evaluating real-life ICPS cyber incidents. Finally, we identify the general shortcomings and highlight the points that cause a gap in existing literature while defining future research directions.",

These studies are also guided by community research organisations such as the Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) [144] to prevent insecure integration. This leads to several cybersecurity challenges due to (i) high connectivity, (ii) increased attack surface, and (iii) heterogeneous infrastructure. Any disruption to availability resulting from the compromise of CIs can have a catastrophic impact, particularly when those CIs support the fundamental needs of society. The survivability of the CIs depends on the security of ICPSs. Protection approaches that focus on CPS security such as anomaly detection [151] , secure routing [107] , use of game theory and utility metrics [14] , and watermarking [150] , cannot be directly applied to ICPSs that differ from CPSs in many aspects. The security challenges for ICPSs require unique solutions that consider harsh industrial environments. Even though there is a growing number of publications, the literature that focuses on ICPS security is quite diverse. This independent presentation and evaluation of complementary topics and diversity makes it challenging to produce a unifying taxonomy, evaluation metrics, implementation techniques, and test environments.",

Several surveys [55, 73, 116] classify IDS techniques, review security and privacy issues, and describe the need for a security framework. Surveys of the current challenges for various ICPS architectures are covered in [99, 176, 185] . The technical review of control engineering tools is presented in [78] while a review of the key enabling technologies and major applications of ICPSs can be found in [112] . ICPS attack detection techniques are surveyed in [39, 40, 56, 71, 140] . Several proposals [33, 54, 103, 146, 180, 184] introduce IIoT, study state-of-the-art implementation, and give an outlook on possible solutions while mentioning future research directions.

However, although there are similarities, we believe CPS and ICPS security should be treated as distinct research areas due to attributes (based on the differences between Information Technology (IT) and Operational Technology (OT)) that are unique to industrial environments. This survey focuses on the cybersecurity solutions offered by academia for the most common vulnerabilities reported by three industrial cybersecurity reports [168, 169, 173] to find an answer to the question of what academia is offering against the most common ICPS vulnerabilities. It also analyzes these solutions based on several key features (e.g., used dataset, if machine learning (ML) is applied or not). We evaluate the real-life incidents based on the taxonomy that we developed as we believe that the previously developed taxonomies lack certain elements to examine these attacks. Then, we introduce the communication technologies and protocols. We also analyze the current situation of the ICPS edge networks as they are the main targets of cyberattacks that target ICPS. The cybersecurity perspective of the survey is limited to the offered solutions against the vulnerabilities determined by the cybersecurity reports [168, 169, 173] , and surveys/papers that focus on edge security, datasets, and testbeds. Our selection criteria are based on the relevance of the papers to the above-mentioned topics and the publication years of these papers.

Conventional manufacturing, automation, and computing systems are started to utilize IIoT by implementing cloud infrastructures [146] . IIoT is composed of two main parts as an ICPS: the cyber part (e.g., sensing, networking, computing) and the physical part (e.g., sensors, actuators). Thus, we can identify IIoT as a subsection of an ICPS. The defining feature of IIoT is the Internet connection provided via network nodes that offer remote management. In addition, the rapid development of cloud technology has made IIoT more attractive as it provides efficient processing and storage of big data [180] . The increasing heterogeneity of IIoT has led to the development of Web of Things (WoT) [33] to solve interoperability problems.

There are several CPS architectures present in the literature. The most basic one is the 3C CPS architecture presented in [18] where 3C means control, communication, and computation. Other available CPS architectures that classify the CPS domain in a more detailed way are 5C [96] and 8C [79] . These processes are completed by a variety of interconnected components that provide real-time multiprocessing. Commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) products that perform the computation on the edge, and forward pre-processed data to the cloud (to minimize the system load/delay in industrial automation systems) are such an example.

OT systems often operate and respond to events in real time. The adoption of mobile devices in OT provides ubiquitous access to authorized personnel. Major ICPS suppliers such as Schneider Electric [126] and Rockwell Automation [142] have used mobile technologies for over 20 years now. ICPSs were also previously isolated from any outer networks. Hence, they were automatically being protected from outsider threats. The only option for an adversary to attack a system was physically inserting data (i.e., via USB sticks) when in physical proximity to the system, as IT and OT domains were kept separated. In today's ICPS, OT has started to adopt IT-like technologies (e.g., TCP/IP protocol, Windows as an OS) because of the benefits [28] they bring. However, controlling and monitoring OT devices via IT systems causes new vulnerabilities to appear as the \"security through obscurity\" approach is no longer applied. The implementation of new security measures requires the harmonization of IT and OT strategies and an understanding of the basic differences between the two technologies, as summarized in Table 2 . New trends such as fog and cloud computing drive further convergence of IT and OT. In addition to these, wireless technology is also now more robust [31] and deployable for harsh industrial environments. We believe that in the future, IT and OT will be integrated, and holistic approaches will form a base for future studies. Hence, while legacy ICPS components had obvious borders/differences, in today's systems this border is fading away. Hence, for example, it is possible to see a single device that can act as both PLC and HMI.",

There are two main communication protocol types in terms of standard availability: open and proprietary protocols. Open protocols may be developed by a single or group of vendors and may require a license fee. They can be utilized with multiple vendors and also supported by a third-party software. On the other hand, proprietary protocols are developed and controlled by a single vendor. They are strictly restricted under legal terms. Legacy industrial systems had proprietary protocols, therefore making manufacturer companies dependent on certain vendors. These protocols had been designed to achieve the best efficiency without considering security as a primary concern. The principle of security through obstruction was followed. However, even though there are still such systems, most of the ICPSs are no longer air-gapped and some of them are even adopting cloud technologies. This makes open protocols more secure, and popular than the proprietary ones as they are developed by non-profit communities that keep them updated. Also, most companies prefer being more independent [2] when establishing their ICPS as they may integrate their systems with other components when needed. The features of communication protocols for wireless and wired technologies differ from each other in many aspects. Legacy systems were mostly utilized wired communications technologies, unlike today's ICPS which have a combination of both. Wired protocols such as Modbus and BACnet are also compatible with many wireless technologies including Zigbee [153] . Wireless technologies are easy to deploy but may suffer from interference in an environment with high noise like electric distribution facilities. Wired communications are more reliable in terms of speed but For example, networks with mesh topology are more robust but have higher cost, while bus topology costs less but is more prone to failures. Hybrid topologies are preferred in the existing ICPSs.",

This led to the development of fieldbus technology. The first ones came as proprietary protocols but later most of the major automation companies established groups/alliances and shared their licenses because the end-users required more heterogeneous production environments. Industrial Ethernet. The industrial communication technology started to shift to industrial ethernet from fieldbus because of the promises (i.e., very low latency) that ethernet offered. Wireless. The future industrial systems are expected to adopt more wireless technologies because they are easy to deploy and scalable. They also allow a low-cost remote management without requiring additional setup. Early wireless systems lacked authentication schemes while having high latency which made them inadequate for industrial systems.

Open protocol mainly developed for building automation and control networks [22] and also utilized in the heating ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) industry. The protocol is maintained and developed by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) [13] . Recently, BACnet Secure Connect (BACnet/SC) is proposed by ASHRAE to prevent problems when integrating IT systems into OT infrastructure for cloud-based applications [51] . DeviceNet. Open protocol developed by ODVA [124] . The reduced number of wires with high flame resistance makes the DeviceNet network suitable for solar applications [154] . However, the increased number of nodes in DeviceNet causes an exponential increase in time delay [12] which may raise an issue for real-time complex networks. Industrial Ethernet. Profinet. Open Industrial Ethernet Standard developed and administrated by the PROFINET International (PI) organization [136] that has around 1,700 members. It provides a low response time that is ideal for real-time applications. The connection is provided by an ethernet jack that offers high flexibility. Profinet networks can easily interact with the IoT infrastructure [16] . EtherCAT. Ethernet-based open communication protocol designed for automation to minimize the delay within the industrial network. EtherCAT Technology Group [48] maintains the protocol. EtherCAT has a low implementation cost and also provides high-speed real-time communication with low latency [123] . Thus, it is suitable for real-time robotic applications [36] . EtherNet/IP. Open industrial protocol currently maintained and standardized by ODVA [125] . The EtherNet/IP network can be expanded by ethernet switches that theoretically enables connecting an unlimited number of nodes [104] . That also makes EtherNet/IP easy to implement for highly interconnected ICPSs. It offers several network structures including ring, star, and linear.",

It is administered and standardized by the Zigbee Alliance [188] . Being a low power solution and allowing remote management makes Zigbee suitable for environmental monitoring [26] . Bluetooth. Open wireless communication protocol that is designed as a Personal Area Network (PAN), managed and standardized by Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG) [183] . Currently, the latest standardized version is Bluetooth 5.0. The rapid development of Bluetooth accelerates its integration into industrial applications. Not supporting mesh topology was a big downside of Bluetooth, especially regarding industrial applications, and led the proposal of academic solutions as seen in [34] . Therefore, Bluetooth SIG added this feature and standardized it, which is considered as a huge step in Bluetooth technology. LoRaWAN. Open wireless low-power wide-area network (LPWAN) protocol developed by Semtech maintained and standardized by LoRa Alliance [109] . It is arguably one of the most common LPWAN protocols utilized in many applications ranging from agricultural to home automation. LoRaWAN is suitable for smart home applications but for real-time monitoring, it should only be used where the application does not require a very low response time [1] . Wire-lessHART. Open wireless communication protocol based on the IEEE 802.15.4 standard developed by Field COMM Group [49] for industrial control applications. WirelessHART devices have the ability of bidirectional communication that is advantageous for mesh networks. A comprehension of WirelessHART with several wireless standards is presented in [62] . ISA-100.11a. Open wireless communication protocol based on the IEEE 802.15.4 standard developed by ISA [130] to provide flexibility for industrial automation systems. ISA-100.11a supports mesh and star topologies. It can also communicate with multiple protocols via gateways, thus allowing coexistence of wireless networks. 6LoWPAN. IPv6 over Wireless Personal Area Networks (6LoWPAN) [120] is a wireless communication protocol based on the IEEE 802.15.4 standard that is developed and standardized by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) [74] . The development of 6LoWPAN was significant for IIoT as it has provided an IP-based solution for a range of devices. However, IP-based solutions raise security concerns due to increased connectivity.

Even though these systems are complementary to each other, there is an inadequate number of studies that examine the security of them under the ICPS roof. This leads to different study inputs such as taxonomies and evaluation metrics while making it harder to generate a common output for further research. Therefore, we have surveyed the studies that are also related to these systems and realized there is a need for multi-dimensional adaptive ICPS attack taxonomy. In this section, first we define ICPS attack taxonomy and evaluate real-life ICPS incidents. Then, we summarize key findings from several ICPS vulnerability assessment reports [168, 169, 173] . Finally, we define ICPS security characteristics and review proposed countermeasures against most common ICPS vulnerabilities. General Kim et al. [86] Nuclear Power Plant Loukas et al.

(4) Attack Scope: ICPS is a combination of cyber and physical systems. The attack may target not only the cyber but also the physical domain or both. For example, if the attacker accesses the network and steals data, that attack is cyber only. However, if the attacker gains control of the actuator via unauthorized network access, the attacks become cyber-physical. The only physical attacks are also possible such as physical theft or physically damaging an ICPS equipment. Thus, the scope is divided into three: cyber, physical, and cyber-physical. (5) Attack Domain: Describes the attack pattern. Defining the attacked domain is significant because similar attacks may require similar countermeasures and categorizing them hierarchically supports developing an adequate security plan. We include the multi-dimensional attack domain taxonomy of Common Attack Pattern Enumeration and Classification (CAPEC) [24] , which is sufficient, detailed, and up to date. There are six main attack domains defined by CAPEC: software, hardware, communications, supply chain, social engineering, and physical security. For example, a common \"e-mail injection\" attack goes into the following categories in order as follows: software and parameter injection. where the attacker remains undetected for an extended period. We also utilize the multidimensional attack mechanism taxonomy of CAPEC [24] in this case. ( 7) Attack Type: The cyberattacks are divided into two categories in general: active and passive.",

(8) Targeted Principle: There are three main information security principles: confidentiality, availability, and integrity. Confidentiality refers to the protection of data from unauthorized third parties. Availability refers to the data being accessible by authorized parties whenever needed. Integrity refers to the data being complete and uncorrupted. These three are defined as the CIA triad. One attack may target one or more principles at the same time.

                "text": "Three essential principles that must be regulated by password enforcement policies are password change, removal, and encryption. Password change. COTS ICPS devices like PLCs come with a default password that is assigned by the vendor. Thus, it poses a great risk and a new password should be set (see [159] for a real-life incident example) before device deployment while being reset at random intervals. Password removal. Due to the severity of the operations and availability concerns, memorizing a password is not feasible in industrial environments. Therefore, the passwords belonging to operational devices are stored in a local/cloud database. When an employee is no longer associated with the organization, the linked password should be removed from the database to prevent possible abuse. Password encryption. Strong encryption mechanisms need to be applied to secure passwords starting from the authentication step. If the password is transmitted or kept as plain text, an adversary can access it in case of an intrusion. Sarkar et al. [149] address that the password policies for traditional IT networks can be applied to ICPS where the environment contains unique devices such as PLC and RTU. They propose a security-oriented password policy for ICPS with a detailed password creating guideline. Korman et al. [90] evaluate the effectiveness of several ICPS cybersecurity countermeasures including password policy enforcement. Authors analyze the available CPS security assessment tools based on three techniques: network segregation, strengthened access control, and patch management. They claim password policy enforcement complements network segmentation to secure CPSs. 4.4.7 Least Privilege. NIST [162] suggests applying the least privilege principle as a part of the defense-in-depth strategy for ICPS. It provides minimal access to a software/user required for essential tasks when needed, while the task number is being kept at the minimum. This provides easy to analyze systems with higher overall security. Least privilege can be provided via the application of role-based access control (RBAC) that assigns certain access rights to dedicated roles. Such a work is presented in [83] where authors implement RBAC to the industrial remote maintenance system. They evaluate the proposed system on Raspberry Pi 3 by setting up virtual hosts. They claim such an implementation as a standalone security mechanism can be implemented to remote maintenance systems as a countermeasure against zero-day attacks. Another work [172] evaluates the use of Software-defined networking (SDN) switches to implement the least principle scheme for ICPS. Authors address the cybersecurity requirements on [162] as a motivation of their work while discussing how to implement NIST suggested mitigation techniques via SDN switches. They test the proposed system via two different SDN switches (real-life testbed) and claim ICPS can benefit in terms of least privilege networking from such an implementation.",

They apply the knapsack problem and develop an optimization model for two different cases: multiple targets and separate resources, multiple targets and shared resources. They claim such a combinational optimization can be applied for resource allocation. Another model for this issue is presented by Wang [175] . The author utilizes mathematical cyber breach probability models to develop a function as a solution to the resource allocation problem. They address that the organizations can benefit if they apply the least privilege principle and access authentication schemes before allocating security resources. Srinidhi et al. [161] analyze the resource allocation problem from the manager's perspective and claim that managers tend to over-invest specific security methods that are effective in the short run due to financial distress that they are faced with while investors prefer more productive ways that are more effective in the long run. They propose a resource allocation decision-support model for managers and investors utilized in case of a breach. 4.4.9 Account Management. Additional accounts in ICPS networks are used in exceptional (e.g., error, intrusion) situations. These temporary/emergency accounts may have access to critical assets. Hence, they need to be removed/disabled once their use is completed. Such an action should be regulated by an access control policy. Valenzano [171] proposes a role-based twofold access control policy model for industrial systems. The author emphasizes the difficulty of validating access policy enforcement. Thus, most solutions in this context either assume that the policy is either enforced or propose an additional software/hardware extension. The model proposed by the author clearly outlines the usage conditions on edge mechanisms. Ren et al. [141] utilize blockchain technology to implement identity management and access control to edge IIoT mechanisms. The access control policy is defined by the edge network terminal, hence automated. Their evaluation shows that the proposed model can efficiently work in the IIoT edge which is a resource-constrained environment.",

However, providing an additional access point increases the attack surface, thus new security measures should be set based on a security-oriented access control strategy/model before enabling remote access. The main access control models that are implemented in industrial environments are discretionary access control (DAC), mandatory access control (MAC), role-based access control (RBAC), and attribute-based access control (ABAC).

The data taken from these are either sent to the command and control (C&C) center to be checked by the control engineer or handled by autonomous control units. The final phase of the attack against an ICPS includes faking sensor values to delay the activation of SIS.

                "text": "Among the characteristics that determine the overall security of an ICPS, the most overlooked one is a redundancy (see Section 4.5) that also directly contributes to the resilience of the system. The German Steel Mill incident [97] is such an example of the lack of redundancy where the incident could have been prevented if there was an additional system to shut down the furnace. Regarding resilience, imagine the rotating speed of the fan is altered by an adversary to cause a fire in the manufacturing line. If the fan can go back to a normal state without causing a fire, we can define that system as resilient. In industrial environments, only the most significant elements (i.e., electricity) are considered from these perspectives where cyber-physical edge security mechanisms are subject to replacement when they fail which makes the ICPS vulnerable during the replacement process. Deploying an alternative system for each process is not a feasible option (in most situations, the cost will be too high) due to the heterogeneity of an industrial environment. The same is also applied to industrial networks. As we mentioned in Section 2, ICPSs may benefit from a highly interconnected network that also increases the attack surface (see [105] for a real-life incident example). This case becomes more significant when there is inadequate boundary protection (see Section 4.4) as we have also seen from the vulnerability assessment reports [168, 169, 173] . Thus, two main challenges arise: (i) how can we determine the industrial assets that require back-up systems and (ii) how should we implement them. The risk assessment has to be done to analyze available options. Regarding ICPS edge resources, we may question the abandonment of the air-gapping policy in ICPSs. Deploying supervision/security mechanisms to the same network allows the adversary to bypass them by manipulating their outputs forwarded to the control center [30] . Thus, deploying edge security mechanisms on an air-gapped secondary network seems like a promising further research topic.",

To achieve the most realistic results, real-life datasets and testbeds are required. Experimenting on real and active ICPS is often limited due to possible disruption in CIs. Hence, the use of realistic testbeds and synthetic datasets [15] that benefit from being privacy-free (the reason behind the lack of efficient publicly available datasets) and safe to gather are the most feasible options. We believe the development of advanced industrial simulation environments [68] that can generate robust synthetic datasets to be utilized with ML models is a significant future direction to be considered. To generate such a dataset where the privacy of the data is out of concern, and that contains both malicious and normal traffic, either we can conduct attacks (a similar approach to the Simian Army [69] may be applied) or deploy honeypot to the ICPS testbed network. However, achieving a suitable sized dataset is still a challenge when generating synthetic datasets. On the other hand, realistic evaluation becomes more challenging if we consider the studies regarding industrial security policies where the efficiency of the policy is mostly determined by the aftermath of the real attacks. Possible directions include simulating actual incidents based on developed policies and the development of an evaluation framework that differs according to industrial environments.",

We analyzed the ICPS architecture by defining its components and emphasizing the unique characteristics of OT systems. We provided an analysis of ICPS communication protocols. We proposed an adaptive attack taxonomy, then evaluated reallife ICPS cyber incidents. We analyzed the latest trends on ICPS edge security. Then, we surveyed the growing ICPS cybersecurity literature to determine how academia approaches against ICPS vulnerabilities. We evaluated studies that propose ICPS security mechanisms based on the evaluation metrics that aim for continuity. We argued about the datasets, testbeds, ML techniques, and security policies that will shape the future of ICPS security. In all the papers we surveyed, no paper proposes a framework that explains the relationship with complementary industrial systems. The less utilization of realistic testbeds, lack of up-to-date datasets, and no evaluation framework to compare AI/ML techniques are also among the major challenges. In addition, the most common vulnerabilities are either due to weak boundary protection or lack of enforcement of well-designed security policy.
