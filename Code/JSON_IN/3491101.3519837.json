This public attention has equally highlighted the capacity of highly-engaging games to adversely impact particularly vulnerable populations [9, 46] ; surfacing numerous accounts of young children's spending of tens of thousands of US dollars on casual mobile games [3, 14, 32, 39, 48, 50, 55] , and the description of certain players as 'whales,' enthusiastically sought after by game studios for their vast monthly spending [16] . Many of these critiques can be related to broader criticisms of digital technology as detracting from daily life, reducing autonomy, serving as distraction, and manipulating thoughts and behaviour -often leading to polarised discussion of personal, social and corporate responsibilities across public media, online fora, and the academic literature alike [43] [44] [45] 49] .",

Prior research has focused on the development of defnitions and ontologies of dark patterns [21] , including not only loot boxes but playing by appointment, grinding, reciprocity, and many more. These design patterns are often posited as a result of the nature of game development as not only a creative but commercial process comprising practices of design, implementation and user testing driven by quantitative data and business metrics including retention rates and lifetime value measures [7, 53] . The adverse efects of highly-engaging game experiences are often then described as an inevitable consequence of the adoption of dark patterns in the pursuit of a proft motive. A richer understanding of the adoption, implementation and use of dark game design patterns may yet however allow us to facilitate and prioritise the ethical design and development of digital technologies of all kinds.",

This is a challenge signifcantly complicated by twin ethical dilemmas at the heart of the experience and adoption of dark patterns. The frst pertains to the degree of personal responsibility and autonomy granted to players in weighing questions of ethical engagement. As one indie game designer put it; \"diferent kinds of experiences are meaningful to diferent people, and . . . we shouldn't judge people for what is meaningful to them\" [12] . The second, less studied, concerns the involvement of multiple stakeholders in the design, development and commercialisation of mobile games. While some have argued that the only solution to the adoption of manipulative design patterns is to \"shame the developers away from using them\" [34] , such moralising in practice tends not only to lead to polarised conversations but may also serve to mask the complex combination of values at play in the process of highly-engaging game designan industry practice into which researchers currently possess little insight. Industry professionals have commented that the \"responsibilities (for digital wellbeing, ed.) lie everywhere and with everyone\" [33] .

                "text": "User Engagement. Much HCI research in recent years has focused on the engagement of users [15] . With respect to gaming alone, researchers have applied psychological theory to persuasive game mechanics [31] , studied engaging collaborative play [60] , and explored players' motivations for gameplay [23] . Within the gaming industry, the realisation of highly-engaging game experiences is the ultimate aim of most game creators, for reasons both creative and economic. And it is through games, and strategies of gamifcation, that we have often proved most successful at engaging users [44] . User engagement design is supported by a wide variety of strategies, measures and theories, including and often most prominently, self-determination theory [17, 27] and fow theory [24, 26, 35] . Cowley et al. posit that games are particularly suited to generating experiences of fow, noting that \"games give immediate access to their inherent potential for optimal experience, and that potential is facilitated by the structured nature of further gameplay\" [11] . Gaming is therefore a domain in which we have proved strikingly successful at designing for engagement.",

                "text": "Dark Patterns. So successful in fact that some have begun to worry about the ethical ramifcations, and practices of ethical decisionmaking, entailed in the process of game design. Recent years have seen increased attention devoted, in particular, to the topic of dark patterns [42] . Much of this work has focused on identifying, defning and categorising strategies considered misleading, manipulative or even coercive. And yet developing an ontology of dark design patterns is itself far from an easy task; the efects of these strategies dependent on a wide variety of individual characteristics, and their defnition morally-contingent. Zagal et al. comment, for example, that game design patterns are best thought of as 'value-neutral tools' yet admit that this \"does not necessarily make them useful for identifying problematic or unethical design choices made by designers\" [58] . Recent eforts by HCI researchers to further our understanding of the relationship between GCs' intentions and players' experiences include assessment of the impact of dark patterns on users [13, 20, 36, 56] and the creation of new guidelines for GCs [1, 34, 47] . Lukof et al. suggest new design norms as means to mitigate the efects of dark patterns; including shaming companies which employ dark patterns, requiring GCs to articulate the ethical values underlying their design practice, and incorporating material concerning dark patterns into design curricula. Fitton & Read similarly ofer a framework to support critical consideration of dark patterns in the creation of free-to-play games, to be employed during game design to \"help creators of free-to-play apps focus on the experience and wellbeing of younger users even when monetization is essential\" [18] .",

Divergent brainstorming and mind mapping exercises then enabled the generation of concept solutions to the challenge of designing healthy, highly-engaging games. These were expanded and iterated upon together with stakeholders during the co-design workshops of phase 3 -four workshops conducted with participants in pairs -and then further developed and refned using knowledge and insight from these interactions during phase 4. In phase 5, stakeholders were again consulted during workshops for the iterative co-design, testing and validation of these concepts.

All GCs and BDs resided in Europe, while only three players did so, four living in North America and one in Asia. All participant interactions took place over Zoom, and were organised using email and Discord, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We employed the virtual work-space tool Miro to support the creation and use of several novel visual research methods for the reciprocal activation and creative engagement of participants in co-design. This included, for example, an ice-breaker and needs-fnding exercise entailing the sorting of dark patterns (See Figure 2 ), and another involving the interactive placement of initial concept solutions according to axes of perceived value and feasibility.",

Some GCs argued that dark patterns could simply be 'stumbled' upon or 'fallen' into, whereas others spoke of these patterns as intentional, immutable and inescapable design choices driven by market forces beyond their control; \"We have ads every 30 seconds. That's a lot, right. We do it because that's what everyone else does. I cannot aford to only show an ad every minute\" (BD1). This trend was therefore described by GCs as motivated not by greed but a desire to remain working in the mobile game industry. GCs and BDs also spoke of dark patterns as arising as a result of data-driven engagement metrics, as surfacing inevitably over time, as related to other drivers of engagement, and as a consequence of a culture of disposable experiences; \"I'm going to do everything I can to make sure that you stay here and you click on [our game] again . . . I know that you don't actually care about this stuf I've made, you just try to distract yourself\" (DS2).",

Some BDs defended certain patterns, including in-game purchases, as increasing the options available to players; \"It makes it possible to create deeper layers inside of the game\" (BD1). Others returned to the inevitability of dark patterns given market forces, refecting a difusion of responsibility possibly attributable to a bystander efect [2] . A small minority of GCs however counted themselves responsible, and expressed deep discontent with \"very exploitative forms of game design\" (DS3). DV3, in particular, spoke of a consistent pattern of what they considered 'trickery' in game design as motivating their departure from the industry, \"sick of developing those games.\" For the majority of participants however, responsibility was to some extent shared among players, parents, GCs, and industry fgures, noting that it was not always a design pattern that was itself dark by nature but rather its implementation. Prior defnitions of dark patterns tend to relate their presence to intentional decisions autonomously made by technology creators [58] . Participants' comments suggest however that we might also fnd value in defning the 'dark game design pattern' as a pattern or combination of patterns implemented in such a way that it drives players towards experiences negatively afecting their wellbeing.",

And the development of hyper-casual games in particular was found to present a variety of highly-unique features. These are games often developed in a period as brief as two weeks (DS1), each kept as simple as possible in terms of theme and gameplay, and focused around only one or two gameplay mechanics; allowing these games to be easily understood, and immediately satisfying to play. Such games were described by creators as the result of a 'super data-driven' approach designed to keep players in a hyper-casual loop, and easy to play to the extent that winning becomes trivial. Many hyper-casual game studios work under a publisher, which additionally helps developers to inform their design choices using data gathered from the \"successes and failures of thousands upon thousands of games\" (DS1). This further enables not only the dissolution of responsibility for design choices, but makes it difcult for individual stakeholders to make their voices heard. This was refected most starkly in participants' comments as to the implementation of monetization in mobile games as a point of tension and confict between diferent professional roles within development studios, as between studios and players. Many game designers and developers spoke openly of their games and gaming as being 'corrupted' by their colleagues in business development, and of fghting against the inclusion of these practices; \"every game . . . started out as people with a passion for a thing . . . and as it keeps going, it turns into a company thing, 'how do we make more money?' \" (DV2), \"it was 'us against the business guy' \" (DS3). Although the implementation of dark patterns might therefore be characterised as a conversation, it is one in which GCs described themselves as having little voice; \"you know what I would say if they invited me. That's probably why I'm not invited\" (DS2).",

Considerations in the design of this concept included prioritising core principles of glanceability and legibility, enabling access to multiple levels of information, and avoiding explicit moralisation. A unique icon was created for each dark pattern; the type of pattern (temporal, monetary, social or psychological) denoted by a coloured border, and these icons displayed as a stack. Clicking an icon would result in the presentation of a more detailed description to users, facilitating the education of players over time including in regard to the efect of multiple patterns in combination -an interaction highlighted by players as key to their impact. By simply listing those patterns present, this concept attempts to refrain from granting weight to the often-polarising nature of the public and professional debate regarding dark patterns. A Healthy Game Design Course. Findings of this work highlighted GCs' striving to create and participate in conversations around more ethical practices of monetization, yet also a lack of confdence and knowledge among GCs in contrast with BDs. Our second concept takes the form of a Healthy Game Design Course designed to grant GCs the knowledge, tools and skills to implement new and alternative monetization design patterns in co-operation with other industry professionals. This concept was communicated drawing inspiration from standardised university course descriptions. Our workshop participants envisioned a workshop format as most effective, during which students would learn about dark patterns and possible alternate monetization strategies, actively engage in design problems, analyse games containing dark patterns, and work on healthy alternatives in groups. This course would additionally make use of real-world examples to simulate production conficts, providing creators the tools to participate in such discussions on more equal terms, and in this way contributing towards more ethical practices of monetization.",

Our fnal concept comprises an Emotion Assessment Toolkit designed to elevate developers' knowledge of players' experiences, leveraging not only interaction logs and retention rates but ecological momentary assessments of players' mental states as means to inform practices of decision-making in support of healthy highly-engaging game experiences. Key considerations in the design of this tool were the questions posed to players and considered useful by developers as means to both generate knowledge and foster empathy with players. During workshops, participants were asked to rank a variety of emotional states in regard to their value for informing game development. GCs selected as most valuable the negatively-valenced emotions 'annoyed', 'disappointed' and 'manipulated', and the positive emotion 'interested'. Participants highlighted 'interested' as a felt experience \"very unique and hard to achieve, \" (DS3) and therefore an indicator of healthy engagement, and the negative emotions chosen as among \"the most unintentional things that might happen in the game, \" (DS3) noting that a game would never strive to entice such feelings in players, whereas other negative feelings, such as 'frustrated,' could often be intentionally elicited to drive further investment from players.",

We advise researchers seeking to support such practices by design to; a) elevate game players' capacity to transparently weigh the presence and impact of game design patterns, as a means to combat manipulative monetization mechanics, b) empower all stakeholders of game play and design to make their voices heard, overcoming siloed mentalities and adversarial relationships, in support of the development of an ethical gaming culture, and c) increase GCs' capacity to access rich and diverse forms of knowledge about players' experiences, beyond data driven-design.
