        "text" : "In recent years, with the rapid development of Internet, Internet of Things, satellite communication and other fields, people begin to research and seek for the new communication technologies to pursue greater communication capacity and communication quality [1] [2] . At the same time, the development of fiber communication technology, such as erbium-doped fiber optical amplifier, Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing, and Synchronous Digital Hierarchy. Optical fiber communication has become the focus of research in recent years due to its wide transmission frequency band, large communication capacity, small transmission loss, strong anti-electromagnetic anti-interference and anti-corrosion ability, small size and simple installation. Free-space optical communication has the characteristics of both wireless communication and optical fiber communication, and has attracted extensive attention and research because of its advantages such as no need to apply for frequency license and large communication capacity. However, freespace optical communication still faces some technical problems. At the input of the receiving system of the communication system, the laser beam needs to be coupled into the single-mode optical fiber. Because the fiber core is only a few microns, the control of laser beam needs to be very accurate. However, when the laser propagates in the atmosphere, due to the influence of atmospheric turbulence, the jitter of the transmitting platform, static alignment error or noise, some aberrations and external disturbances will be caused, and the coupling efficiency of the optical fiber will be affected at the receiver [3] [4] . Through the experimental simulation, it is found that the static error which affects the coupling of optical fibers is mainly the lateral deviation. And when the beam in the outer space propagate through the atmospheric turbulence, the wavefront is introduced with tip/tilt aberration and mismatch with the field of the SMF, which is the main factor which affects the coupling of optical fibers, i.e., the coupling efficiency (CE) .To solve the problem, an adaptive coupling system based on the fast steering mirror (FMS) and a wavefront sensor is proposed to compensate the aberration [5] [6] [7] . Recently, a new adaptive fiber coupling system was designed and can control the coupling process by directly driving the fiber tip, which can achieve higher coupling efficiency and faster response speed [8] [9] . In the adaptive fiber coupling system, the adaptive coupling algorithm is the core field. Because of the complexity of the coupling system, the researchers regard it as a black box system and construct the fiber-optic coupling problem as a model-free optimization problem. At present, many methods for coupling optimization have been proposed. For example, the gradient decent [10] , hill climbing [11] and annealing [12] and other methods, but the CE of these methods is still low. In 1997, in order to solve the problem of image distortion caused by atmospheric turbulence, Vorontsov proposed to apply the modelfree SPGD learning algorithm in the neural network to the adaptive optical system [13] . And it is applied to fiber coupling to improve the coupling efficiency. Since SPGD algorithm was proposed, it has been widely used to solve the actual problem. Nevertheless, SPGD algorithm still has some defects in fiber coupling. It may Meanwhile, the coupling speed of SPGD algorithm still has room for improvement [14] . Recently, researchers have proposed some improved methods to address the weaknesses of SPGD algorithm. Such as the single-mode fiber coupling method based on grating spiral scanning and SPGD algorithm, the precise delay SPGD algorithm applied to adaptive fiber coupling [15] . Although most of the methods have been optimized to some extent, however, it is still difficult to meet the high coupling efficiency and real time requirements of actual fiber coupling. In this paper, inspired by ADAM, Momentum and other deep learning [16] , a new coupling algorithm based on gradient descent is proposed. Considering that the gradient of the objective function in the actual scene of fiber coupling cannot be accurately calculated, the gradient is estimated through the SPSA and then use it to take place of the exact gradient in the deep learning optimization algorithm. New algorithm that combines the SPSA to estimate the gradient and the iteration point update strategy of the deep learning algorithms is obtained by integrating the SPSA and the deep learning algorithms like GD, momentum, RMSprop, Adagrad and Adam. Comparing these methods' convergent performance through the simulation and analysis, the conclusion is that the SP-Adagrad algorithm has best performance in speed, convergent efficiency and robust.",

In the Zernike polynomial, Z1 and Z2 represent tilt aberration along the x and y direction, respectively. And the tilt aberration accounts for almost 87% of the total wavefront aberration caused by the atmospheric turbulence. Since the tilt error of the incident Angle of the beam can be equivalent to the transverse offset error of the receiving surface of the optical fiber, there is an approximate linear relationship between the control voltage in X and Y directions of the FMS and the polynomial coefficient a1 and a2, so the coupling efficiency of the optical fiber is optimized by adjusting the polynomial coefficient in the simulation process.",

Because the finite-difference (FD) can accurately estimate the gradient, in order to better analyze the optimization characteristics of different algorithms themselves, we firstly use the FD to calculate the gradient and then the optimization is carried out in combination with different optimization learning algorithms. As shown in Figure 3 , when the initial point is close to the optimal point, the coupling rate of Adagrad algorithm is very fast at the initial optimization stage. In general, several deep learning optimization algorithms can reach the vicinity of the optimal point with the highest coupling efficiency of 68% within ten iterations. As the distance from the initial position to the optimal point gradually increases, AdaGrad can still maintain good coupling performance and fast coupling rate, however, the coupling performance of other When the initial point is [1.9,1.9], only AdaGrad and GD can be coupled to the highest efficiency value, but GD algorithm is much slower than Adagrad algorithm.",

Because the gradient estimation of SPSA algorithm is random, the method of taking the average value after ten simulations is adopted to reduce the random error and the result are shown in was studied in detail. In the simulation, we changed the ∆u from 0.0001 to 2.5 and explore the impact on SP-Adagrad coupling efficiency. The Figure 7 shows that when ∆u is 10-4,10-3,10-2,0.1,0.5 and 1.5 respectively. The SP-Adagrad can maintain a coupling efficiency of 65% within 120 iterations, and when ∆u becomes to 2.5, the coupling performance deteriorates significantly. Besides, we inquired the effect of ∆u on the initial coupling point, ∆u was set to 1 and the initial point is 2.7, the coupling performance are shown in Figure 4 (f), it still maintain fast convergence speed and a good coupling efficiency within 20 iterations. In a nutshell, SP-Adagrad has strong robustness to the variation of ∆u, and proper control of the hyper-parameter ∆u can effectively improve the dynamic of the initial point, which means it can have better coupling performance in the face of large aberrations compared with other optimization algorithms.",
