    "abstract": "With advances in network capabilities, the gaming industry is increasingly turning towards offering \"gaming on demand\" solutions, with cloud gaming services such as Sony PlayStation Now, Google Stadia, and NVIDIA GeForce NOW expanding their market offerings. Similar to adaptive video streaming services, cloud gaming services typically adapt the quality of game streams (e.g., bitrate, resolution, frame rate) in accordance with current network conditions. To select the most appropriate video encoding parameters given certain conditions, it is important to understand their impact on Quality of Experience (QoE). On the other hand, network operators are interested in understanding the relationships between parameters measurable in the network and cloud gaming QoE, to be able to invoke QoE-aware network management mechanisms. To encourage developments in these areas, comprehensive datasets are crucial, including both network and application layer data. This paper presents CGD, a dataset consisting of 600 game streaming sessions corresponding to 10 games of different genres being played and streamed using the following encoding parameters: bitrate (5, 10, 20 Mbps), resolution (720p, 1080p), and frame rate (30, 60 fps). For every combination repeated five times for each game, the dataset includes: 1) gameplay video recordings, 2) network traffic traces, 3) user input logs (mouse and keyboard), and 4) streaming performance logs.",

The concepts of cloud computing are leveraged to render the game scene as a video stream which is then delivered to players in real-time. Such a concept allows users to play video games on remote hosts, as if the game was running on their own PC, often with the aim of making use of the host's superior hardware. The service is conceived as a cyclical process which consists of sending the user's inputs to the host and reproducing them, and displaying audio and video received from the host on the client PC. Ideally, the service would offer performance akin to playing directly on the host and the user would experience no audiovisual or temporal issues emerging from client-host communication.",

                "text": "The main advantage of this approach is the capability of delivering high-quality graphics games to any type of end user device, however at the cost of high bandwidth consumption and strict latency requirements. Despite attracting significant media attention, early commercial cloud gaming solutions such as OnLive [7] met with failure due to relatively low availability of high-speed Internet access required for the system to function without noticeable visual artifacts and input delay [23] . The aforementioned drawbacks were, however, largely remedied in recent years and cloud gaming has once again emerged as an attractive alternative to traditional gaming [1] [2] [3] 8] , further exacerbated by the ongoing global GPU shortage [18] . A number of industry leaders have been expanding their services by implementing their own game streaming solutions (e.g., Sony's Playstation Now service [3] , Xbox service [2] and Amazon Luna [1] ), with Sony operating the one of the world's most widespread cloud gaming platforms with more than 3.2 million subscribers [4] . Moreover, some game companies provide in-home game streaming that includes the streaming of video games from a local server to other devices in a local network. This approach is applied in Sony's Remote Play service [5] and Valve's Remote play service [6] for the PC gaming platform Steam.",

                "text": "Recent ITU-T standardization efforts [15] present an opinion model for cloud gaming QoE. The model was developed based on the work reported in Recommendations ITU-T G.1032 and ITU-T P.809, and it uses an impairment factor approach to estimate MOS based on the impact of network parameters (delay, packet loss) and video encoding parameters (video resolution, bitrate, and frame rate) on video and input quality. A key challenge thus faced by cloud game providers lies in configuring the video encoding parameters so as to maximize player QoE while meeting bandwidth availability and low latency constraints. Previous studies have addressed ways in which to categorize games, going beyond traditional genres and incorporating various video metrics, for the purpose of assigning appropriate video encoding adaptation strategies [14, 21, 22, 26] . On the other hand, considering the network provider perspective, QoEdriven resource management mechanisms can be applied. However, with widespread use of traffic encryption and a lack of insights into app-level data, methods for traffic classification and Key Performance Indicator (KPI) estimation from encrypted traffic are a potential way forward [20] .",

The collected dataset consists of raw video data and a variety of objective metrics collected through the use of Steam's Remote Play cloud gaming platform [6] in a controlled environment by an experienced player. The dataset features 10 games from different game genres to diversify the objective game characteristics that we collected. Each game's data was recorded in 12 distinct scenarios defined by combinations of video bitrate, resolution and frame rate parameters of cloud gaming video stream. Furthermore, for each game we recorded 60 cloud gaming video sessions, as we repeated each scenario 5 times in an effort to capture characteristic game scenes for each game. Overall, the dataset contains 600 different cloud gaming gameplay videos, together with the captured network traffic and user inputs.",

As QoE requirements vary across different game genres, the effectiveness of QoE-aware service adaptation depends on appropriate selection of video encoding settings for the concrete game or game genre. Thus, for each of the selected games, we recorded gameplay video traces (played by an experienced gamer) with different video encoding parameter settings (resolution, frame rate and bitrate). Encoding settings used in data collection are summarized in Table 3 . The FRAPS 1 application (version 3.5.99) was used to losslessly record gameplay sessions that lasted exactly 30 seconds each. Each recorded video was saved in .avi format. Furthermore, for each combination of video encoding parameters we recorded 5 video traces in order to obtain a large enough sample of characteristic gameplay for each tested game. To summarize, we collected 600 gameplay video traces totalling more than 853 GB and corresponding to 5 hours of cloud gaming gameplay.",

Based on captured network traffic, it can be observed that Steam Remote Play uses UDP for streaming video/audio and user inputs. Furthermore, the service employs a closed protocol which generates a negligible traffic size in comparison with the recorded video traffic size. Additionally, each .pcap file was converted to a .csv file, more suitable for data analysis. Overall, we gathered more than 20 GB of cloud gaming network traffic.",

We selected four games from the dataset varying in terms of graphic details and gameplay pace (differences described in Table 2 ). Each dot represents a single recorded gaming session played at 60 fps with a bitrate of 20 Mbps. It can be observed that calculated objective video metrics vary from game to game, thus representing different ranges. Furthermore, it is clearly visible that video metrics of recordings for slow-paced games (Company of Heroes 2 and Ring of Pain) are clustered, whereas games with high gameplay pace (Dirt 5 and Doom) exhibit noticeable variations. Further, it can be observed that for higher resolution (1080), SI metric values are higher than in the case of lower resolution (720p), although TI metric values are nearly same. This demonstrates that comparing the data from multiple resolutions may result with misleading interpretations (e.g., when comparing collected data with the data from previously published datasets). Furthermore, it should be noted that plotted TI/SI scores represent maximum values of TI/SI values from the whole video trace, which may not be appropriate for gaming videos as a sudden change of scene will result in a high TI score, and the entire video trace will be classified with a high TI score, even if the rest of the gameplay is much slower paced. Therefore, we also calculated and plotted average TI/SI values, as shown in Figure 4 . It can be observed that the average TI/SI scores for the same game are more clustered as compared to the maximum TI/SI scores. Additionally, we advise researchers to compute alternative objective video metrics (such as PFIM and IBS [13] ) which may be useful in the process of choosing appropriate video encoding adaptation strategies [22] ).",

In our analysis we focus on investigating the impact of game type and resolution on different network characteristics. Therefore, as shown in Figure 5 , we investigated the mean throughput of recorded network traces for the selected games. It can be observed that the downlink bandwidth usage (the video data delivered from the server to the client) varies between games, with fast-paced games using all available video bitrate. Slow paced games, on the other hand, have on average lower downlink throughput than fast paced games, since they contain more static, infrequently changing game scenes. However, the download bandwidth usage does not differ between gaming network traces of the same game streamed at different video resolutions, as video bitrate output size primarily depends on the scene complexity and the gameplay dynamics, not on the resolution. When we look at uplink bandwidth usage (the user input data delivered from the client to the server), it is substantially lower compared to the downlink bandwidth usage. Varying downlink bandwidth usage is evident for the selected games, while in the case of fast paced games (Dirt 5, Doom), we can also see a variation in mean throughput for network traces streamed at different resolutions. These findings suggest that the traffic throughput may be utilized to identify different game content for cloud gaming streams, however the results for different resolutions do not show clear differences in bandwidth usage. We further investigate the impact of different types of games on uplink packet interarrival times and throughput, with results shown in Figure 6 . We can observe that games with different game pace may have similar uplink packet interarrival times (e.g., Doom and Ring of Pain), and vice versa (e.g., Dirt 5 and Doom). A more in-depth analysis is necessary to explore additional network characteristics with the aim to derive a meaningful mapping between application-level parameters and observed traffic characteristics.",

Furthermore, as our dataset contains additional data besides video traces, a novel QoE estimation model for cloud gaming based on objective video metrics, network traffic and/or user input could be proposed and its performance compared with existing cloud gaming QoE models.",

Alongside raw video files, the dataset also consists of captured network traffic during these cloud gaming sessions, corresponding users input, and application-level statistic summaries of sessions. To the best of our knowledge, CGD dataset is the first cloud gaming dataset that includes captured network traffic and data on user interactivity alongside recorded gameplay videos, which makes it highly relevant for future work on automating the process of configuring video encoding settings and estimating video quality for cloud gaming.",
