    "abstract": "Communication trends demand services that require flexible multicast transmission with requirements for data processing functions at the network nodes. This challenge is achieved with softwaredefined networking (SDN) and network functions virtualization (NFV) technologies. In the multicast routing problem in NFV-SDN networks, the goal is to compute a multicast tree and the location of virtual network functions (VNFs) at nodes, satisfying the traffic demand and processing functions with the least possible resource. The traffic flow must pass through a VNF node before reaching a destination node. Since the problem has high computational complexity and current proposals consider only one type of virtual function in all demands, the development of scalable solutions for multiple sessions with different virtual functions is necessary. This paper addresses the multicast session routing and VNF placement (MSVNFP) problem in NFV-SDN networks as a joint optimization problem. In this context, we propose an approach based on Genetic Algorithms (GA) called MSVNFP-GA. Given a set of multicast demands, the proposed algorithm calculates for each demand a tree and the location of VNFs seeking to minimize the total cost of links and node activation. Numerical simulations on different network topologies and traffic loads show that MSVNFP-GA is promising compared to the state-of-the-art competitive algorithms.",

Also, many multicast services require network functionalities such as firewall, load balancer, network address translation, flow monitor, and others. These functionalities can be implemented through the middle-boxes [15] . However, current networking approaches based on the manual configuration of proprietary devices are tedious and error-prone, limiting the capacity of the physical network infrastructure [11] .

However, those studies have considered a partial version of the problem by imposing a single type of VNF for all multicast requests (homogeneous placement) and not controlling the maximum capacities of the links and the computational capacities of the nodes where the VNFs are located, so as not to overload them. In more realistic problems, each request could require a different type of VNF, impacting a higher complexity of the MSVNFP problem. Developing efficient strategies that address the problem posed is fundamental for the success of the problem and the purpose of this work. Genetic Algorithms (GA) are recognized for their efficiency for optimization problems, so their application to the MSVNFP problem is of current research interest [3] .",

This scenario was implemented in all three topologies. Table 3 presents the evolutionary parameter settings. MSVNFP-GA is a stochastic algorithm, so each run performed may present different results. Then, the simulation considered several independent runs for each scenario. The final results of the MSVNFP-GA implementations are the average values obtained from all runs of each scenario. In terms of computational time, the proposal requires a much longer computational time than the state-of-the-art proposals. The time difference is a ratio of 244 to 1 on average. This difference occurs because UMF, RMF, and IMF are heuristics, and MSVNFP-GA is a meta-heuristic.",
