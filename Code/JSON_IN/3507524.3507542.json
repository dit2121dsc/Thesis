In a typical airborne or missile-borne platform, in order to respond quickly to the environment of the highvalue target to be detected, the radar only has a short observation window length and cannot obtain enough data for clutter environment perception, leading to a problem of clutter environment perception under the condition of few data. Aiming at the problem of insufficient clutter environment data, this paper proposed a clutter environment perception method based on prototypical network. It employed the High-Resolution Range Profile of wideband radar as the recognition data, and first used data in the training set to calculate the prototypes corresponding to different clutter environment features. Then, the distances between the features of data in the testing set and the different prototypes was used to realize the perception of the clutter environment. The measured data on microwave anechoic chamber showed that the methods used in this paper can obtain effective perception results for the three typical natural environments of grassland, cement, and asphalt.",

With the continuous addition of various military weapons and equipment, the situation faced by radar sensors on the battlefield has become more and more severe [3] [4] . To face these challenges, a Canadian scholar [5] proposed the concept of cognitive radar. It clearly pointed out that cognitive radar is an intelligent radar system with the ability to simulate human cognitive processes. The cognitive radar system first understands its own natural and electromagnetic environments based on the early radar echoes, and then adjusts the its transmitter and receiver parameters based on the results of the environmental perception to achieve the purpose of adapting to the complex working environment. Thereby it can break through the performance bottleneck of the classic radar system.",

                "text": "Environment perception [4] refers to the use of various recognition methods to identify the type of clutter in the environment where the observation target is located. By analyzing the echoes of the working environment, radar system regards the result as a priori information to the subsequent detection and tracking data processing, so as to improve the adaptability to the environment and improve the radar performance. Classical clutter environment perception methods [6] [7] use the empirical model of electromagnetic scattering, and perform parameter fitting based on measured data to estimate the statistical distribution of clutter. And then the statistical distribution features are input into the classifier to realize the recognition of the clutter environment. However, in complex scenes such as ports, beaches, forests and grasslands, traditional statistical modeling methods cannot effectively fit the clutter distribution model, and the ability to understand the environment is severely restricted. Therefore, some scholars [8] have proposed an environment perception method based on deep learning. However, when the radar is on a fast-moving platform, due to the short observation time window, it is often impossible to obtain enough echo data, causing data-driven deep learning methods to fail. In this regard, this paper proposed a clutter environment perception method with few data based on prototypical network. ",

The recognition principle of the prototypical network is given in Figure 2 , where c 1 , c 2 and c 3 denote the prototype obtained from the support set, x is a sample to be classified. The prototype network classifies x by comparing the distances from different prototype points.
