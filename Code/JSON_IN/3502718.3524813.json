For learning programming languages like Java or Python, both types of learning content are well represented. However, for learning Structured Query Language (SQL), current work predominantly focuses on SQL problems with automatic assessment [6, 18, 22] . This paper attempts to bridge this gap by introducing and evaluating Database Query Analyzer (DBQA) [13] , an online learning tool for SQL worked examples that interactively illustrates and explains the stepby-step execution of SQL SELECT statements. We report the results of a large-scale randomized control study where DBQA examples were used by learners among other types of interactive learning content through an online SQL Practice System. In our analysis, we focus on the usage and the impact of DBQA, as well as the effect of textual step explanations provided by DBQA.",

Worked examples are comprised of the presentation of a problem, the solution steps, and the final solution. Students use these examples as models of how to solve certain types of problems. A sizable body of research on the use of worked examples for acquiring cognitive skills has been accumulated in various domains, such as mathematics and physics [2, 27] . This research has consistently shown that in the early stages of skill acquisition when students typically have little or no domain knowledge, instruction that relies more heavily on studying worked examples is more effective for learning than the traditional approach of being focused on only problem-solving. Previous work has shown that early example-based instruction leads to better learning outcomes, which are reached in less time and with less effort [16, 28] .",

Animated examples do not limit the example presentation to just showing students the code of example programs, but allow the students to see the code executed step-by-step using program visualization [26] . The use of step-wise program visualization enables students to see the internal state and intermediate results or program execution, which are usually hidden [11, 19, 25] , and thus better understand the behavior of program constructs [29] . More recently, there have been several attempts to develop other types of worked examples that focus on code exploration rather than code animation [8, 31] ",

DBQA illustrates intermediate data sets similar to those maintained by the database management system during the processing of the query (Figure 1 ). Upon query submission, DBQA processes clauses in an SQL SELECT statement in the following order (if present): FROM, WHERE, SELECT, GROUP BY, HAVING, and ORDER BY. For each clause and condition, DBQA highlights the query component being processed and updates the intermediate data set displayed to the student accordingly. \"Next\" and \"Previous\" buttons allow the student to step forward and backward in the query execution, allowing for procedural-like query execution and illustration. Students can highlight already executed clauses by checking the \"highlight previous steps\" checkbox. Additional features in DBQA allow the learner to view all tables, columns, and keys in a database, as well as view all data in those tables.",

The goal of the SQL Practice System is to provide access to four types of interactive learning content that can help students to practice SQL topics. Since the system was designed to be used in a free mode, i.e., students can choose when and how to practice, the interface of the practice system was designed to help students with monitoring their progress and choosing the most appropriate content to practice. The access to all four types of interactive learning content is organized by topics and augmented by an open learner model (OLM) [4, 9] . The goal of OLM is to increase students' awareness of their learning progress. As seen in Figure 2 , there is a topic-based (A) and concept-based (B) OLM. The grid (Fig. 2A me row) represents the average progress of a learner for each topic, which increases by completing activities within a topic (Fig. 2C ). The darker color of the cell indicates a higher level of completion in a topic or an activity. In parallel, as the student works with the problem-solving activities (i.e., Query Analysis and Query Execution), estimations of their knowledge level on the different SQL concepts are calculated based on their correct/incorrect attempts [30] . These estimations are shown through the length and the color of the concept bar chart shown in Fig. 2B , where each bar represents an SQL concept covered in the course. The longer and the greener the bar, the higher the estimated knowledge of this SQL concept. Students can explore the OLM by ( 1) mousing over the topics to get an overview of the concepts that are introduced in each of these topics, or also by ( 2) mousing over the learning activities to know which concepts can be practiced through each activity.",

From the Query Demonstration row, students can access worked-out examples presented through DBQA. Query Analysis row provides access to SQL problems served through SQL-Tutor [22] , a constraint-based tutor for teaching SQL, where students have a structured SQL select query template to answer a given SQL problem. SQL-Tutor provides multiple support and feedback options such that students can see the errors associated with their queries based on well-defined constraints, and even ask for a partial solution. Finally, Query Execution activities are problems that assess learners' SQL knowledge and are solved by writing free-form SQL select statements for a given problem text. The submitted query is evaluated against a model solution using a sample database, and immediate correct/incorrect feedback is provided. These problems are served through SQL Assessment Tool (SAT) [6] and generated through pre-defined templates. Every time a student accesses a problem, the problem text is randomly selected from a predefined problem set. SAT has another unique feature, query build mode that allows learners to run their SQL queries multiple times and lets them see the actual query result before submitting it as an answer for assessment. Attempts to both SQL-Tutor and SAT are used by the student modeling component to update concept-level knowledge estimates. In this study, students had access to 63 annotated examples, 42 DBQA examples, 52 SQL-Tutor problems, and 55 SAT problems through the practice system.",

By collecting exercise points, students can improve their (passing) exam grade by up to 1.5 grades on a scale of 0-5, where 1 denotes a pass and 5 is the best grade. The opportunities to earn exercise points differed considerably between CMS exercises and the SQL Practice System, reflecting their role in the course. CMS exercises on various course topics were designed more as an assessment tool. Each solved exercise earned exercise points and was the means by which students could earn most of their points. In contrast, SQL Practice System was offered for additional practice for students who needed more support to gain SQL knowledge. It was accessible through a link from the CMS, and the incentives to use it were much weaker to avoid \"practicing for points\" rather than knowledge. While the practice system offered a large number of problems and worked examples for 11 SQL topics, only up to 22 exercise points (about 8.4% of the maximum available exercise points) could be earned through this system. More precisely, students could earn up to 2 points per topic by solving two SQL problems (1 for each type), and no points could be earned by working with examples. The status of the earned points was visible to students as shown in the top-left corner of Figure 2 (e.g., Extra Points Earned: 5/22).",

Following our prior research findings [3] , we concentrated on success rate related features. We considered using the overall success rate and first-attempt success rate in both the SQL assessment tool (SAT) and SQL-Tutor as features. To test such connections, we can only consider students who had both pre/post-test scores and used the SAT and SQL-Tutor at least once (N=110). We performed a backward step-wise feature selection process to pick the important usage metrics. This process picked the overall success rate in SAT and pre-test scores as features. Then, we fitted a linear regression model to predict post-test scores using these features. We found a significant model (\ud835\udc39 (2, 107) = 14.8, \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc57.\ud835\udc45 2 = .20, \ud835\udc5d < .001) and the results indicated that the overall success rate was a statistically significant predictor (\ud835\udc35 = 7.50, \ud835\udc61 = 3.433, \ud835\udc5d < .001, \ud835\udf02 2 = .10) of post-test scores after controlling for pre-test scores (\ud835\udc35 = 9.15, \ud835\udc61 = 4.189, \ud835\udc5d < .001, \ud835\udf02 2 = .14), such that a 10% increase in success rate was associated with a 4.8% increase in post-test scores. We believe that given the intelligenttutoring-system nature of the SQL-Tutor and multiple feedback/hint options (e.g., partial solution request), the success rate in SQL-Tutor problems was not a significant factor in this analysis.

Hence, we further hypothesized that exploring worked examples might affect students' problem-solving behavior in this study as well. To test our hypothesis, we fitted negative binomial generalized linear models (due to over-dispersion) to predict the number of attempts using the query build mode in SAT. We controlled for prior knowledge and the number of distinct SQL problems attempted (i.e., students who practiced with more problems might need to use query build mode more).

Similarly, ANOVA on the average execution steps revealed a significant interaction effect (\ud835\udc39 (1, 8 7) = 7.357, \ud835\udc5d = .008) with small-to-medium effect size (\ud835\udf02 2 = .08), but no main effect of OLM type (\ud835\udc39 (1, 8 7) = .197, \ud835\udc5d = .659) and of step explanations (\ud835\udc39 (1, 87) = .938, \ud835\udc5d = .336). As shown in Figure 3 , post-hoc analyses on average step executions revealed that students who received textual step explanations explored significantly more steps ( \ud835\udc40 = 3.35) compared to students who did not have access to these explanations (\ud835\udc40 = 2.32), but only in conceptbased OLM condition (\ud835\udc39 (1, 87) = 6.6, \ud835\udc5d = .012). A similar conclusion was reached from the post-hoc analysis of the exploration ratio. Thus, the effect of textual explanations on both average step executions and exploration ratio depends on the type of OLM visualization. To summarize, students who had access to textual step execution explanations tended to view more steps on average and fully explore a higher number of examples. However, such an effect only exists when students had access to fine-grained OLM design. ",

Hence, in this section, we explore the effect of textual explanations throughout the course. We computed the average number of execution step views per week per student for the concept-based OLM condition. As shown in Figure 4 , students in textual explanation condition worked with DBQA much more at the beginning of the semester (i.e., during the first two weeks). Then, this gap between conditions disappeared for the 3rd week of the semester. After the 3rd week, students engaged with DBQA examples consistently more when represented with textual explanations. To confirm our visual inspection, we further conducted an ANOVA on the average step count with week number and DBQA condition as factors. The ANOVA revealed a significant main effect of the DBQA condition (\ud835\udc39 (1, 13) = 8.963, \ud835\udc5d = .010) with a large effect size (\ud835\udf02 2 \ud835\udc5d = .408) but the week number was not significant (\ud835\udc39 (1, 13) = .478, \ud835\udc5d = .501).

Exploring more query execution steps in DBQA was associated with a higher success rate, fewer query building attempts, and higher persistence during problem-solving in SAT. Finally, we explored the effect of textual explanations and open learner model features on the usage of DBQA and found out that students who accessed textual explanations viewed more steps on average in DBQA and fully explored a higher number of examples.
