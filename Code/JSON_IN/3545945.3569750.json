The goal in our exploratory curricular initiative is to dovetail the need to teach these two critical, emerging topics in highschool, and create a suite of novel activities, 'AI & Cybersecurity for Teens' (ACT) that introduces AI/ML in the context of cybersecurity and prepares high school teachers to integrate them in their cybersecurity curricula. Additionally, ACT activities are designed such that teachers (and students) build a deeper understanding of how ML works and how the machine actually \"learns\". Such understanding will aid more meaningful interrogation of critical issues such as AI ethics and bias. ACT introduces core ML topics contextualized in cybersecurity topics through a range of programming activities and pre-programmed games in NetsBlox, an easy-to-use block-based programming environment. We conducted 2 pilot workshops with 12 high school cybersecurity teachers focused on ACT activities. Teachers' feedback was positive and encouraging but also highlighted potential challenges in implementing ACT in the classroom. This paper reports on our approach and activities design, and teachers' experiences and feedback on integrating AI into high school cybersecurity curricula.",

The rate at which cyberthreats are developing is increasing daily. The average security operations center (SOC) receives over 11,000 alerts a day, and 28% of all alerts are never addressed [3] . Like every other arena where big data are fueling the use of automation through artificial intelligence and especially the prolific AI subfield of 'machine learning' (AI/ML), cybersecurity professionals see AI/ML as the solution to growing problems of \"too much data to analyze\" and \"poor/insufficient automation of threat detection and response processes.\" As AI/ML applications pervade every corner of our day-to-day lives, innovation today cannot be separated from AI. In the context of cybersecurity, AI can learn normal patterns of data and systems to help detect and protect against malware, ransom, trojan horses and other threats; and on the flip side, increasingly sophisticated abilities to manipulate images, audio/video using \"deep fake\" AI techniques present new challenges and cyberthreats. Although, cybersecurity education is crucial for all learners, there can be no cybersecurity conversation today without AI/ML in the mix. Building an understanding of these two fastest-moving subfields of computing in an integrated way makes cybersecurity and AI education authentic to today's reality. Providing engaging learning experiences in secondary school develops career aspirations and interest, thus making such endeavors productive and beneficial for tomorrow's citizens.",

These experiences typically cover Cybersecurity First Principles, the Confidentiality-Integrity-Availability (CIA) triad, concepts such as cryptography, network security, viruses and malware, and promote cyber awareness as well as cybersafety. AI/ML do not feature in these curricula. Separately and concurrently, AI efforts in K-12 e.g. AI4K12 [24] and AI4All are gaining momentum thanks to the availability of AI services that can now run sophisticated AI/ML algorithms in a web browser. However, most of these efforts introduce AI concepts such as machine learning, classifiers and predictors, and neural networks through extant pre-trained models, explorations are not specific to any domain or context, and involve little real programming that lifts the hood on how machine learning actually happens. This leaves learners with an amorphous understanding of AI and does little to address the opacity of the \"magic of AI\" in learners.",

Given the issues outlined above, our project tackles the need for cybersecurity and AI/ML education for high school students in integrated and mutually beneficial ways that are authentic to today's needs. Cybersecurity issues provide an excellent context for an introduction to AI/ML, and AI/ML issues in cybersecurity empower learners with the knowledge and wherewithal to address new challenges and opportunities in cybersecurity. Lastly, AI is also considered an exciting, game-changing technology of our time that impacts all aspects of our lives. By meaningfully intertwining the learning of cybersecurity and AI/ML for learners in their early teens through engaging real-world examples, programming exercises, and playful explorations, we also tap into the potential of building interest in more young teen learners, and especially females and students from historically marginalized groups, at a time considered critical for STEM identity and interest development [23] .",

Hence, a core goal of our exploratory project was to design and seek feedback from cybersecurity teachers as well as train them on these materials so that they could then integrate them into their curricula. This experience report describes the design of a suite of curricular activities-AI & Cybersecurity for Teens (ACT)-that leverage the intersection of Cybersecurity & AI, highlight suitable cybersecurity contexts and real-word situations (as \"hooks\") for integrating AI into cybersecurity classrooms, and teach AI/ML models in ways that lift the hood on how the machine actually \"learns\". We believe that such deeper understanding of AI is essential to critically interrogate issues of ethics and bias in ML models, as well as develop the kind of adversarial thinking [26] that is a core skill of both cybersecurity as well as AI. We also describe teachers' feedback and experiences from two ACT PD workshops. We believe this report will be valuable in sharing these activities and materials (freely available at cyberai4k12.org) with the broader highschool CS community and be useful for both highschool Cybersecurity and AI teachers. We also hope it will provide an impetus for upgrading K-12 cybersecurity curricula.",

In lower grades, it takes the form of cyber-awareness and cyber-safety; at the high school level, there are efforts to make cybersecurity learning more authentic with the goal of raising interest in cybersecurity careers. Designing cybersecurity curricular that are creative, socially relevant and accessible to K-12 students is a challenge [19] . A meta-analysis of 12 published papers between 2010-2021 revealed that topics covered in K-12 cybersecurity education typically include security of data, software, systems, humanbehavior, organizations, and society. [4] . The meta-analysis also revealed that teachers find it challenging to teach cybersecurity as they lack age-appropriate tools and resources to teach cybersecurity related to network issues. The authors concluded that \"to make cybersecurity education a success at the K-12 level, strategies and approaches need to be used to prepare teachers for teaching cybersecurity through evidence-based curriculum, teaching materials, tools, technologies and other resources. Teachers must be provided with ongoing professional development. \" AI/ML. The current \"AI in schools\" movement has received growing attention since the 2019 release of the \"Big Ideas\" for K-12 AI education [24] . Many AI for K12 teaching materials reside as curated lists of \"resources\" maintained by AI4K12 and CSTA. Most of these involve the use of extant pre-trained AI models that students can \"play\" with, such as Quick, Draw!, ThisXDoesNotExist, and Google's Tensorflow Playground. There are also efforts underway to build secondary school curricula that enable students to interact with AI [7] , including some courses focusing on societal impact of AI [18] and AI literacy with a focus on machine learning [15] .",

ACT uses all these pedagogies in addition to programming.

We introduce the basic algorithm in pseudocode, then provide \"subgoal\"-inspired [16] design blocks for implementing the algorithm and Parson's problems [6, 17] for code completion that have been shown to scaffold programming in introductory courses [8] . At the lowest level, we provide the entire code that implements the algorithm.
