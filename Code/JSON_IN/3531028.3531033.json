Over the last decade, studies have accumulated showing that overuse of the Internet can lead to the development of behavioral addiction. Meanwhile, technological advances have introduced virtual and augmented environment, which allows developer to reduce the time and cost of product development iterations while improving the quality of final products, of course bringing user with richness and immersiveness with large scale environment. It opens up new media and approaches to the gaming experience and online browsing activities. The implications means that immersive technology promises higher design fidelity, resulting in higher quality final products at a lower cost than traditional prototyping technology can offer. Thus, this study want to explore in the qualitative approach on how the design in term of augmented reality product influence the student's behavior in the educational purposes.",

Large investments and acquisitions by tech giants suggest that these technologies will become increasingly integrated with content-consuming platforms. AR and VR offer a whole new creative media as a dreamlike perfect approach to building the world pixel by pixel. This promises to replace linear devices with technology that visualizes the ever-expanding world of concentric circles, providing an unprecedented level of immersiveness for in depth experience. This can be a game changer. It has the immersive nature of technology because users are centered and placed in an ever-expanding virtual world rather than viewing content.",

I'm confident we'll nurture a community from perspective. One potential barrier to rapid advancement in the AR and VR industry is a lack of talent to meet growth demands that go beyond the technical challenges of device size to battery life.

Internet addiction is becoming an ever-growing problem, and the harm caused by the overuse of computers has attracted the attention and interest of experts around the world. Today, the use of the Internet and computers is rooted in modern society and is changing our way of life more than any other technological medium to date.

Recognition is usually done using a camera and the augmented reality is output through the user's screen, phone, monitor, helmet, augmented reality goggles, windows, or car windshield. You can overlay virtual text or images on selected objects in the user's surroundings to display additional information about the selected objects [3] . Today, from a consumer point of view, this technology is still the most widely used in games, but it is also used in specialized applications in the professional context of education, healthcare and real estate. When the idea of AR appeals to viewers, the first step is to decide if you want to sell the right type of product to take advantage of the technology. The next step is to define the right approaches and tools for building proper app or making more sense with the partner once emphasizing the need of the dedication and experiencing in order to make it work.

Addiction behavior is a form of deviant behavior, characterized by a persistent desire for a pleasing subjective emotional state, represented by active changes in mental state. Therefore, the Internet seems to be attractive to addicts who have the ability to relieve stress from the social environment [5] . Internet addicts need emotional support and recognize the Internet as a medium that can provide this support, unlike in a real social environment where it is more difficult to get this support. Internet addiction also leads to the formation of various psychological problems, which only exacerbate the existing social problems of young people and their lack of social experience [6] . Ease of access or minimization has a significant impact on internet and video game addiction. This is because the shorter the waiting time between a substance or mood-altering behavior and subsequent reinforcement, the more addictive the process. The phenomenological overlap observed between Internet addiction and substance and gambling addiction suggests that common neurobiological substrates, including reward system disorders, underlie these disorders [7] . Dissatisfaction will always occur if the actual situation does not meet your requirements and standards [8] . Education aims to improve the quality of human resources and motivate them to look to the future. It also plays an important role in reducing ignorance, recognizing agencies and shaping social behavior [9] .",

In fact, addiction has six psychological components. When applied to the game, the salience of the game controls thoughts, emotions, behaviors, etc., the second is to change the mood of the game for use as a coping strategy or to change the mood, and the third is tolerable score, as it evaluate the degree on the users need to play the game longer to achieve a similar level of mood correction. Fourth, withdrawal symptoms, feeling mentally or physically uncomfortable when not able to play. Fifth, conflicts such as occuring between and/or individuals resulting from game behavior, and finally recurrences that go back to old patterns of play after a period of abstinence. These six factors closely correspond to the drug dependence criteria of both the DSM-IV-TR and ICD-10 [13] .

It consisted of cycle phases of recognize, scrutinize and materialize, which is the simplification of design thinking CH [21] . Therefore, it has a specific meaning to provide what you need based on the specific features you need by designing the best user experience when using the service or product. In economics, the concept of utility is used to model value or value as its use has evolved significantly over time. It can be defined as the benefits and joys that consumers can get from services and goods. Therefore, it is important to meet market demand by focusing on the core issues as catalysts by providing solutions by bringing interactions within the application system. Actually, user experience design as the design philosophy used in this study related to a collective term for every types of activities that improve the user acceptance and satisfaction when using an application through typical features. In this case, unity was used as the development software through the utility principles. It have been divided into three layers based on R (user preferences, shared values, open innovation and collaborated ecosystem), S (spectrum of devices, spatial interfaces and structural instantiation) and M (dimension of learning and applied rule). Therefore, in order for a project system to be successful, it must not only be aesthetically pleasing but also present practical, comfortable and useful value. By implementing user experience design in the process, users can be emotionally connected and satisfied when interacting with the system [22] .",

In short, human rule represent that the design activity should emphasize the social attribute in nature by bringing back to human centric point of view considering the cultures, habits or behaviors. Therefore, tangibility rule related to the concept of making the ideas have been formulated to the feature that can facilitate the integration and communication as the proper and suitable media platform. Meanwhile, balancing rule explain the attempt to put harmonization between market demand and economic pressures. On the other hand, ambiguity rule describe the preservation of experimenting the limits of user ability to perceive or interpret the function differently and lastly, the redesign rule allow every design to be changed based on certain circumstances based on the user needs. Thus, the dimension of learning should be conducted first as trial error in designing the plan for augmented application.",

Presence design, on the other hand, should be useful for increasing user enjoyment by enabling collaborative feedback, providing filtering, and providing many menu features to increase dialogue. Overall, the learning curve for developing AR models was initially very steep as we were new to open source and free 3D creation software. On the other hand, there is important concept that is important to consider, which mental workloads based on the theory of limited working memory capacity, cognitive workload and limited cognitive ability when developing AR applications [26] . The main motivation behind this concept related to measure the mental cost of performing tasks in order to predict operator and system performance by creating a working environment that does not exceed the imposed mental workload. In the end, it will help the development to understand the limit or constraint towards the capacity that is unacceptable based on performance levels. In this case, the AR app is designed as a new approach to elementary school math homework to enhance interaction and experience. Thus, in the figure 3 , the first and second page was presented as the final interface design as well the guideline in 'bahasa Indonesia', which were translated as 1. Open Application, 2.

In short, utility criteria were not used to replace important positions in many common design aspects but putting priority as the fulfilment to this proposed finger rule will accommodate those aspects inherently. There are also some features to avoid, such as avoiding overwriting spaces in your AR app, and being careful about mixing carousels, scrolling and zooming areas, and hamburger menus. Therefore, the designer must also take into account the time it takes to move the space. This could interfere with the interaction.
