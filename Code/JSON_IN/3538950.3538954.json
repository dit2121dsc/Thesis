Literature [3] proposes a Flink task scheduling algorithm FSACE oriented to the container environment. By obtaining the performance information of each node and the distribution information of the container on the node, the container of the node with more free resources is preferentially selected to avoid the container being blocked. Frequent selection results in uneven load, improving resource usage and computing speed. Reference [4] improves the parallelism of multi-table connection calculation by optimizing the connection algorithm inside Flink, shortens the job running time, and reduces the network IO cost in star connection. Reference [5] combines Flink batch processing technology and machine learning algorithm to improve the adaptability of SVM algorithm in big data platform. The second is to develop and design some applications with high real-time performance, mainly because there are many master's thesis in some colleges and universities. Reference [6] utilizes Flink's real-time stream data processing for real-time monitoring. Reference [7] uses Flink's real-time attributes for data mining. The third is to use Flink as a component for specific fields. Reference [8] uses Flink for iterative fault tolerance, thereby improving its efficiency. Literature [9] uses Flink for triangle counting, so as to achieve the purpose of graph data mining.",

The content of the website is mainly expressed in the form of hot words. It is assumed that the words that appear more frequently are the issues that users are more concerned about. The evaluation of website content is performed by word segmentation on the user's evaluation, and the processed words are compared with the emotion dictionary and mapped into three emotion words of \"positive\", \"negative\" and \"unknown\", and an analysis chart is formed.",
