In this paper, we propose an integrated fabrication method for one-step FDM 3D printing (FDM3DP) kinematic mechanisms to create dynamic objects without additional post-processing. We describe the Arch-printing and Support-bridges method, which we call All-in-One Print, that compiles given arbitrary solid 3D models ",

Some of the research projects utilize the properties of materials to 3D print objects whose shapes can vary with temperatures [31, 39, 40, 55] or electric [56] . Some explore metamaterials [2, 7, 30, 37, 53] to control the elasticity of 3D-printed objects as a whole, and other work proposes diferent mechanisms to make 3Dprinted or laser-cut objects fexible and easy to deform. These mechanisms include 3D printed joints [3, 45] , linkages [10, 12, 14, 36] , hinges [22] , truss structures [8, 13, 32] , grid structures [26] , and compliant mechanisms [9, 16, 54] .",

This compensates for the sinking efect of the printed material. If the printing speed is slower than 30mm/s, the printed part can quickly solidify and selfsupport against gravity. Additionally, we use G-code commands to pause the printing for several seconds after the bridge layer is printed, ensuring that the base layer of the arch is solid. To make a more defned expression, we build a basic model to describe our method. As shown in Figure 4a , a single bridge consists of two fat parts: the support pillars and the curved arch. The length of the arch along the X-axis is referred to as the span, and the height along the Z-axis is referred to as the rise (Figure 4b ). By setting up a coordinate system in Figure 4a , we represent the arch curve using a set of convex functions. For example, using a sine function, we can calculate the height of the printer based on the distance it has covered on the X-axis:",

The results generally met our expectations, showing that the appropriate arch rise falls within a specifc range and increases as the span length increases. To make the expression of arch rise more consistent, we defned a standard arch rise of 1.0 for each span length. For example, our tests showed that an arch rise of 0.8-1.0 mm worked best for a 4 cm span bridge. Therefore, we set 0.8mm as the standard arch rise of 1.0 for a 4cm span bridge. Table 1 shows part of our results. An arch rise of 0.75-1.0 can cause the bridge to sink slightly, providing a larger fraction of the gap, while an arch rise of 1.0-1.5 can cause the bridge to arch upward, providing more space in the gap.

Then, with all the separated faces, we calculate the angle of their normal vectors downwards: the closer to the vertical, the more difcult it is to print. In general, they are marked as red (hard to print) to green (well-printable) in Figure 6b . As such, If the red part is connected to the completely green part at both ends (Figure 6b top), it is ideal to be printed by bridging or arch printing (Section 3.1). Otherwise, the part of the load must be supported by Support-bridges. With the initial setting, two bridges are added to both sides of the red area to help the bottom layer be well-printed.

The sum of all layers is the required load, which Support-bridges need to aford. According to the fabrication experience, each flament bridge can sustain a weight of 6g, and the fnal amount is calculated accordingly.
