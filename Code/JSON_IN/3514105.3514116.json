    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel resource sharing scheme for full duplex device-to-device (D2D) communication underlaying cellular network. In the considered scenario, two D2D users share the downlink spectrum resource with two cellular users. When the two D2D users transmit signals to each other, they also act as relays between the base station (BS) and the cellular users so that the cellular users can leverage the redundant capacity of the two full duplex D2D users. To optimize the performance of the scheme, the power allocation is optimized by considering the impact of residual self-interference at full duplex radios and the quality of services (QoS) requirement for both cellular users and D2D users. The simulation results show that, compared to the existing research scheme, the proposed scheme can achieve larger sum channel capacity for the transmission of cellular users, and it can also achieve larger average system throughput at high signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) region.",

For network system, to meet service quality requirements means that users must achieve a higher signal-to-interference ratio, a smaller interruption probability, and a larger throughput and access rate. In order to make more reasonable use of the precious spectrum resources, device-to-device (D2D) communication is proposed because of its short-distance communication and can alleviate the burden on the base station (BS) [1, 2] . In addition, due to the breakthrough of self-interference cancellation technology, scholars have begun to pay attention to the full duplex D2D communication [3] - [5] .",

                "text": "So far, there are mainly two modes for D2D communication underlaying cellular networks: dedicated mode [6] and reuse mode [7, 8] . In the dedicated mode, D2D users and cellular users are allocated different orthogonal spectrum resources, which reduces the utilization of spectrum resources. In the reuse mode, the D2D users share non-orthogonal resources with cellular users. In [9] , a D2D user is utilized as a relay to help the downlink transmission. In [10] , a cooperative N-mode has been proposed. The N-mode uses three time slots to complete the transmission of two cellular signals and two D2D signals, wherein D2D users act as relays of cellular users, thus solving the problem of co-channel interference by power allocation and achieving the purpose of frequency reuse. But this scheme increases the complexity of the system. In [11] , a new model in which full duplex D2D transmitter as the relay of fixed cellular user was proposed, but it does not consider the interference of cellular users. In [12] , an effective resource allocation scheme was proposed aiming to mitigate the interference between D2D communication and cellular networks. However, these papers don't fully utilize the capability of the full duplex radio.",

In order to avoid waste of power, we can finally getR 1 (\u03c4 ) = R 1 (\u03c4 -1)andR 2 (\u03c4 ) = R 2 (\u03c4 -1), i.e.,\u03b3 1 (\u03c4 ) = \u03b3 1 (\u03c4 -1)and \u03b3 2 (\u03c4 ) = \u03b3 2 (\u03c4 -1).

The key is how to divide P m to D2D data and cellular data. Thus, we can relax the residual self-interference to a fix value \u03b1P m in the optimization.

At the same time, under the same channel environment, all schemes show a downward trend with \u03b3 c increasing, and the dedicated mode tends to stabilize because of the QoS requirements of D2D users. As \u03b3 c increases, the power allocated to cellular users increases, so the interference between D2D users and cellular users also increases.

We set different positions of D2D users and cellular users by random and uniform distribution, and evenly to obtain the average throughput. It can be seen that in proposed scheme, the average throughput of the system increases with the increase of \u03b3 c within the range of our simulation. However, in N-mode the situation is just the opposite. There are two reasons to explain it. One is because the function R = log 2 (1 + \u03b3 )is a function with a decreasing growth rate, so cellular users can obtain higher benefits from the allocated power. Another reason is that as the cellular link is allocated more power, the average throughput of D2D link decreases and the average throughput of cellular link increases. But the proposed scheme can obtain more gains from cellular users than N-mode, because the transmission of cellular signals only requires one time slot. And the increase in average throughput of the system is considerable, it can reach 55% when \u03b3 c is 14 dB.",

Thus, the proposed scheme not only can leverage the redundant capacity of D2D links, but also can improve the performance of cellular users. To optimize the performance of the scheme, optimal power allocation is conducted by considering the impact of residual self-interference at full duplex radios and the QoS requirement for both cellular users and D2D users. Simulation results show that although the interference cannot be suppressed well, the proposed scheme can achieve larger sum channel capacity for the transmission of cellular users, and it can also achieve larger average system throughput at high SINR region.",
