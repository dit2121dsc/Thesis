<div class="entities" style="line-height: 2.5; direction: ltr"> Gaming is a more accessible, engaging and popular past-time than ever before. Recent research highlights games as strikingly efective means of capturing and holding our attention -so efective, some argue, to the point of deleterious efect. An impassioned <mark class="entity" style="background: #5D6D7E; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;">CHI2021<span style="font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem">Terms</span></mark> panel discussion directed these eforts towards the ethics and adoption of dark patterns. And yet, we know little as to how dark patterns are perceived and arise in the design, development and use of games. This paper seeks to address this knowledge gap by recounting fndings from a design-led inquiry comprising interviews and workshops conducted with mobile game players, designers, developers, and business developers. We contribute an understanding of how dark patterns arise in the development, use and commercialisation of mobile games, their efects on players and industry professionals, and means for the consideration, negotiation and navigation of these strategies for gamer-engagement by designin support of healthier, highly-engaging game experiences.</div>
