It is a work based on the RV 719 &quot;Hybrid high-speed transmission medium of more coaxial fiber&quot;, the RV 1071 &quot;N-Male connector for hybrid transmission medium with optical fiber&quot; and the RV 1096 &quot;N-Female connector for hybrid transmission medium with optical fiber&quot;, INDECOPI, 2020. It contains in its internal structure an optical fiber for the transmission of data in parallel of high speed by both means. The design and calculation of the parameters was carried out and correlated with their common market peers where the improvement in the design characteristics was demonstrated, the versatility of the proposed design allows the future to unify equipment and technologies.</div>
