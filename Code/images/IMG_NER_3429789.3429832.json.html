<div class="entities" style="line-height: 2.5; direction: ltr"> Online marketplace is a medium for connecting sellers and buyers. Besides that, it is currently more focus on selling products rather than selling services. Usually, if there are products and services in the same platform, the transaction systems will be automatically separated. The purpose of this research is to create an information system that can combine services and product which focuses on beauty for men. The platform can facilitate customers and vendor to buy and sell products and services easily. This research is more focus on the back-end system which uses Node JS as <mark class="entity" style="background: #5D6D7E; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;">REST<span style="font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem">Terms</span></mark>-<mark class="entity" style="background: #5D6D7E; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;">API<span style="font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem">Terms</span></mark> and <mark class="entity" style="background: #5D6D7E; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;">MySQL<span style="font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem">Terms</span></mark> as the database system. Furthermore, in the development phase, the scalability of the system is measured using Apache J Meter to find how many capacities that can be handled by the system. As a result, the system is able to accommodate up to 1500 requests. It is quite good result due to NodeJS has advantages in its features, which is nonblocking to process the data faster.</div>
