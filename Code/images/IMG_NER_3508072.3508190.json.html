<div class="entities" style="line-height: 2.5; direction: ltr"> In this article, the mode composition of the microstructured optical fiber was calculated. The values of the effective (waveguide) refractive index of the first six spatial modes, the propagation of which are supported by an optical fiber, are calculated. The structures of microstructured fiber have been manufactured and presented. An experimental study of the distribution of optical radiation at the exit from the manufactured microstructured fiber has been carried out. The results of the research are presented.</div>
