SDN has the advantages of centralized control, open interface, network virtualiza-tion, etc. and has been applied in various modern <mark class="entity" style="background: #E74C3C; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;">network management<span style="font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem">CSO</span></mark>. However, because the SDN network has the characteristics of central-ized control, the SDN controller will also become a key target of the attack. This article combines mimic defense with SDN technology, focus-es on quantitative analysis of mimic defense in SDN applications, the impact of different defense strategies on the security of the entire system, shows the influence of different conditions on system security, and solves the optimal configuration policy. Finally, experiments are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of different mimicry defense strategies, which confirms our theoretical strategies.</div>
