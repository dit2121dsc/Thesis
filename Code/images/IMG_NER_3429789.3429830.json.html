<div class="entities" style="line-height: 2.5; direction: ltr"> Inibatikita is an online clothing store company which sells its products through multiple online stores, each of which is associated with a partner influencer. Currently, there exist no ecommerce solution which can accommodate this <mark class="entity" style="background: #E74C3C; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;">business process<span style="font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem">CSO</span></mark>. This research aims to develop a system which facilitates this <mark class="entity" style="background: #E74C3C; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;">business process<span style="font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem">CSO</span></mark> while addressing scalability for up to 50000 users. After the requirements are gathered, a system analysis is performed to compare existing ecommerce solutions with a custom solution. Post analysis, system design takes place and is swiftly followed by development and testing; finishing with deployment of the system. The results of system analysis indicate that existing ecommerce solutions aren't able to accommodate a multiple store approach, while a custom NodeJS solution is capable of doing so. Development and testing then proves that a NodeJS solution is able to fulfill the <mark class="entity" style="background: #E74C3C; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;">business process<span style="font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem">CSO</span></mark> while accommodating 50000 users through indexing and caching. The results show that a custom NodeJS solution addresses the business requirements and scalability of inibatikita, when existing solutions could not.</div>
