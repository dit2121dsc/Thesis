To ensure control over the complexity and explainability level of the FDT, we set the maximum number of fuzzy sets in each fuzzy partition to T max . While classical Decision Tree (DT) typically use metrics such as Gini Index or Information Gain to select the most discriminative feature during the recursive tree-building process (see Breiman et al., 1984 for more details), our FDT employs the Fuzzy Information Gain metric for splitting. In our experiments, we stopped the tree-building procedure when the value of the fuzzy information gain fell below a predefined threshold of 10 -6 , as recommended in Segatori et al., 2017. Once the FDT has been generated, we can extract a rule base, namely a set of linguistic if-then fuzzy rules, following each path from the root of the tree to a leaf. Each rule has a weight which is equal to the fuzzy cardinality of the leaf associated with the rule itself. The fuzzy cardinality, introduced in Segatori et al., 2017, is calculated as the sum of the matching degrees of each training instance in each node from the root to the specific leaf.

These two factors impact the explainability of individual rules, particularly influencing the number of linguistic terms used in each antecedent condition and the total number of conditions in the antecedent.
